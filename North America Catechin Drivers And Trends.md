<p><h2>North America Catechin Market Drivers and Trends</h2><p>The North American catechin market is driven by an increasing demand for natural and plant-based ingredients in food, beverages, and health supplements. As consumers become more health-conscious, there is growing interest in the antioxidant properties of catechins, which are believed to help in reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer. The rising trend towards functional foods, along with increasing awareness about the benefits of polyphenols, has further accelerated the demand for catechin-rich products in North America, making it a prominent market in the nutraceutical and food sectors.</p><p>Furthermore, the growing popularity of green tea and its derivatives has fueled the expansion of catechin consumption in the region.
